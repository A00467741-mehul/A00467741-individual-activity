Hello,

My favourite place is Ahmedabad-Riverfront which is in Gujarat, India.

Every time, I visited this place, I will always see people laughing and hanging out with their friends and relatives. Childrenâ€™s like to play in the garden and old age people like to drink early morning tea with their friend.
