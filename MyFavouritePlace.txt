Hello,

My favourite place is Sabarmati-Riverfront which is in Ahmedabad,Gujarat, India.

Every time, I visited this place, I will always see people laughing and hanging out with their friends and relatives. Childrenâ€™s like to play in the garden and old age people like to drink early morning tea with their friend.

Sabarmati Riverfront is a waterfront and it's being developed along the banks of Sabarmati river in Ahmedabad,Gujarat,India. The Construction began in 2005 and since 2012 this waterfront was gradually opened to public.
